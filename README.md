## My process

  ### Built with

  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox

  ### What I learned

  I learned how to center a whole section that I wanted to section. I also learnt how to code the hover element with the color. I used and experimented with Flexbox. 

  ### Continued development

  I want to keep developing and learning how to center divs in css so I can be comfortable with it.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.php) - This helped me with writing and understanding the hover code. 

- [Flexbox Cheatsheet](https://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/) - This is an amazing cheatsheet that helped me a lot with flexbox.
